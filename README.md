# Computer Vision
The computer vision system for the rock paper scissors game was made using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), by training an image project model on images of myself holding up my hand in a rock, paper, scissors, or nothing (including both images of myself holding up no hand, and images of myself holding up a hand but not playing rock, paper or scissors.)

The model is saved in the repository as keras_model.h5. This model is used to detect if the user intends to play rock, paper or scissors in a game of rock-paper-scissors against a computer opponent.
